Easy Image Grayscale
------------
Convert supported image formats into grayscale. Converting to grayscale makes them look better on ereaders that dont support color.

How to Use
------------
Drop the executable file into a directory that contains PNG, JPG or JPEG images and run it. It will convert all images in the directory to grayscale. It will check for duplicates and if it finds any it will skip that particular image. At the moment converting images to other formats and adjusting the quality isnt supported yet.

Requirements
------------
- Windows 7 64 Bit & Up
